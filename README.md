# HTML

## A simple personal profile webpage using HTML that demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML structure, headings, and paragraphs.

### Requirements Used for this project:

1. I created an HTML file named "profile.html".
2. Included the necessary HTML tags to define the structure of the document, such as the `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
3. Inside the `<head>` tag, i added a `<title>` tag to give my webpage a title "My Personal Profile".
4. I used appropriate heading tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a hierarchy of headings on my profile page. For example:
    - Used an `<h1>` tag for your name.
    - Used `<h2>` tags for sections like "About Me", "Education", "Work Experience", and "Interests".
    - Used `<h3>` tags for subheadings within sections if needed.
5. I wrote paragraphs about yourself using the `<p>` tag in each section. Include information such as:
    - About Me: A brief introduction to who i am, my background, and my current situation.
    - Education: A list of my educational background, including the names of the institutions and the years attended.
    - Work Experience: A description of my work experience, with job titles, company names, and brief summaries of your responsibilities.
    - Interests: A list of my hobbies and interests.
6. I used proper indentation and formatting to make your HTML code easily readable.
